# Sets up a MongoDB container and a Mongo Express container using Docker Compose. Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
### The containers communicate with each other to provide a full-stack solution where MongoDB is the backend database, and Mongo Express is the frontend interface for managing MongoDB data.
--- 
### - **MongoDB**: The MongoDB service stores data in a NoSQL database.
### - **Mongo Express**: Mongo Express is a web-based interface that allows users to interact with the MongoDB database, providing an easy-to-use dashboard for managing collections, databases, and documents.
#### Both services are defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
