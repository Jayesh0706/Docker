### 4\. **What Happens if `.dockerignore` is Used Properly**

By including `node_modules/` in `.dockerignore`, you prevent your local `node_modules/` from being copied into the image.

With `.dockerignore` properly configured:

-   **Only the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files** are copied.
-   **`RUN npm install`** is then executed to install the dependencies inside the container, and the `node_modules` directory is **created fresh** in the container based on those files.


---

### Key Takeaways:

-   **If you don't use `.dockerignore`**, local `node_modules/` **will be copied into the image**, but it **won't be overwritten** by `RUN npm install`.
-   **The problem** arises when `node_modules/` is copied into the image unnecessarily, making the image larger and potentially causing conflicts with platform-specific dependencies.
-   **With `.dockerignore`**, you can prevent local `node_modules/` from being copied into the image, keeping the image smaller and ensuring a consistent, container-specific environment.

---

### Conclusion:

-   **The container's `node_modules` will not be overwritten by the local `node_modules`**. However, copying the local `node_modules` into the image is wasteful, especially when `npm install` will recreate the `node_modules` correctly based on `package.json`.
-   **Always use `.dockerignore`** to exclude `node_modules/` from being copied into the Docker image to prevent unnecessary size and avoid conflicts.
